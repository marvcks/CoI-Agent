1. Reflection: Reflect on scenarios where a specific method encounters significant challenges. Consider potential solutions that could effectively address these issues, make the solutions sounds reasonable, novel and amazing.
2. Analogy:  Identify a specific problem you are currently facing. Analyze whether similar issues exist in other fields and how those areas have addressed these problems. Consider if their solutions can be adapted and applied to resolve your current challenge.
3. Deep Dive: Some methods may present specific approaches to addressing a particular problem. Consider whether there are aspects that could be modified to enhance their rationale and effectiveness.
4. Imitate: Analyze the research methods used in previous studies and reflect on how they have progressively advanced the research. Identify common strategies or particularly useful approaches, and use these insights to guide the direction of your next research step. (Most recommended)

Note:Each article's limitations are specific to that particular piece and should not be applied to others.
